    The following figures show different peak location statistics per design. The first figure consists of a pie chart that shows the proportions of the genomic locations of the peaks. The locations are:

    1. Gene (exon or intron)
    2. Proximal (proximal_distance kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    3. Distal (between distal_distance kb upstream and proximal_distance kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    4. 5d (between distance5d_upper kb upstream and distance5d_lower kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    5. Gene Desert (>= gene_desert_size kb upstream or downstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    6. Other (anything not included in the above categories)

    The second and third figures illustrate the distribution of peaks found within exons and introns. The last figure shows the distribution of peak distance relative to the Transcription Start Sites (TSS).
