Column	Description
chromosome	chromosome number
position	position on chromosome
ref_allele	reference allele
alt_alleles	alternative allele
mappability	Mappability flag from simulated dataset (LC = low coverage, HC = high coverage, NODATA = no data, empty = normal mappability)
gene_name	gene name
Nb_Samples	number of samples with this variant
Frac_of_Samples	number of samples with this variant / total number of samples
Avg_Depth	mean coverage of variant over all samples that have the variant
Frac_of_Alt	mean fraction of reads which have the alternate allele over all samples
1000_genome_global_maf	minor allele frequency score (-1 = no sample in the 1000 Genomes database has this variant, 1=all samples in the 1000 Genomes database has this variant)
gene_description	gene description generated by biomart. Derived from Ensembl
go_ids	all GO ids associated with gene
go_terms	all GO terms associated with gene
impact	severity of the change
effect	description of change
effect_type	type of change
codon_change	exact nucleotide change
amino_acid_change	exact amino acid change
gene_type	type of transcript from annotation file
transcript	ENSEMBL transcript ID
db_snp_id	snp id in the db_snp database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/)
1000genome_population_mafs	1000 genome MAF divided by population
CosmicID	cosmic ID and cancer type information from control database of somatic mutations 
InterPro_Domain	description of domain
Uniprot	Uniprot gene ID
GERP_neutral_rate	Neutral rates of evolution (sum of branch lengths)
GERP_RS_score	RS score, the larger the score, the more conserved the site.
29way_SiPhy_score	SiPhy score based on 29 mammals genomes. The larger the score, the more conserved the site.
Polyphen2	Prediction based on HumVar, 'D' ('probably damaging'), 'P' ('possibly damaging') and 'B' ('benign') (separated by ',')
SIFT_score	If a score is smaller than 0.05 the corresponding NS is predicted as 'D(amaging)' otherwise it is predicted as 'T(olerated)'
Normal HomRef	Number of samples homozygous for reference allele
Normal HomAlt	Number of samples homozygous for alternative allele
Normal Het	Number of samples heterozygous 
<SampleName>Depth	Depth of Coverage from sample from DP field
<SampleName>INFO	field from vcf file (GT:PL:DP:SP:GQ) GT: Genotype, PL:  Genotype likelihood (RR, RA, AA), DP: Depth of Coverage, SP: Strand bias, GQ: Genotype Quality
