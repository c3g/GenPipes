### UCSC Tracks

bedGraph Track Format files are generated from the aligned reads using [HOMER]\ [@homer]. They can be loaded in browsers like [IGV] or [UCSC]\ (for UCSC, some naming conventions and/or coordinate limits may cause some problems).

[The coverage tracks are available here](tracks.zip)
