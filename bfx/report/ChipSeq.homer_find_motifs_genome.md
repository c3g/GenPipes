### Narrow Peaks Motif Analysis

De novo motif analyses are performed using [HOMER]. The following guidelines are helpful when intepreting de novo motifs results; a candidate motif should typically have:

* A low p-value (< 1E-50)
* High sequence complexity
* No simple repeats
* A high % of target sequences and a low % of background sequences

The following links will direct you to the HOMER motif results for each Narrow Peak design:
