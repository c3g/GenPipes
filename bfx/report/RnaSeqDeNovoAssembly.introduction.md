Introduction
------------

This document contains the description of the current MUGQIC RNA-Seq De Novo Assembly and Differential Analysis. The information presented here reflects the current state of the analysis as of $date$.

This Pipeline has been developed following the protocol described in the article **_"De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-Seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis"_** [@trinity_protocol] and mostly based on the [Trinity] assembly software suite [@trinity].
