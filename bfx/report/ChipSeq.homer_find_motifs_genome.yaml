  content: |
    De novo motif analyses are performed using [[homer]]. The following guidelines are helpful when intepreting de novo motifs results; a candidate motif should typically have:

    * A low p-value (< 1E-50)
    * High sequence complexity
    * No simple repeats
    * A high % of target sequences and a low % of background sequences

    The following links will direct you to the [[homer]] motif results for each Narrow Peak design:
