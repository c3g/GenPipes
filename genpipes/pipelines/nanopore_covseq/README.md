usage: genpipes [-h] [-v] [-s {bash,zsh,tcsh}]

GenPipes consists of Python scripts which create a list of jobs running Bash
commands. Those scripts support dependencies between jobs and smart restart
mechanism if some jobs fail during pipeline execution. Jobs can be submitted
in different ways: by being sent to a PBS or a SLURM scheduler or by being run
as a series of commands in batch through a Bash script. Job commands and
parameters can be modified through several configuration files.
