DNA-Seq Pipeline
================

A pipeline to process DNA sequencing data. The pipeline uses Trimmomatic for quality control, BWA for alignment to a reference genome, Picard for marking duplicates, GATK for indel realignment and variant calling, SnpEff for variant annotation, SnpSift for filtering variants and MultiQC for aggregate reports.

The pipeline contains protocols for processing both germline and somatic sequencing data; high-coverage data from targeted sequencing experiments; SNVs and structural variants.

The pipeline is designed to be run on a cluster and is configured using a configuration file. The pipeline can be run in a single step or in multiple steps. The pipeline can also be run in parallel to process multiple samples simultaneously.

GenPipes consists of Python scripts which create a list of jobs running Bash
commands. Those scripts support dependencies between jobs and smart restart
mechanism if some jobs fail during pipeline execution. Jobs can be submitted
in different ways: by being sent to a PBS or a SLURM scheduler or by being run
as a series of commands in batch through a Bash script. Job commands and
parameters can be modified through several configuration files.
