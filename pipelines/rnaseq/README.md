RNA-Seq Pipeline
================

The standard MUGQIC RNA-Seq pipeline is based on the use of the [STAR aligner](https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/)
to align reads to the reference genome. These alignments are used during
downstream analysis to determine genes and transcripts differential expression. The
[Cufflinks](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/) suite is used for the transcript analysis whereas
[DESeq](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html) and
[edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) are used for the gene analysis.

The RNAseq pipeline requires to provide a design file which will be used to define group comparison
in the differential analyses. The design file format is described
[here](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines/src#markdown-header-design-file)

The differential gene analysis is followed by a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis.
This analysis use the [goseq approach](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goseq.html).
The goseq is based on the use of non-native GO terms (see details in the section 5 of
[the corresponding vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf).

Finally, a summary html report is automatically generated by the pipeline at the end of the analysis.
This report contains description
of the sequencing experiment as well as a detailed presentation of the pipeline steps and results.
Various Quality Control (QC) summary statistics are included in the report and additional QC analysis
is accessible for download directly through the report. The report includes also the main references
of the software tools and methods used during the analysis, together with the full list of parameters
that have been passed to the pipeline main script.

An example of the RNA-Seq report for an analysis on Public Corriel CEPH B-cell is available for illustration
purpose only: [RNA-Seq report](http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/tools/rnaReport/index.html).

picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

trimmomatic
-----------
Raw reads quality trimming and removing of Illumina adapters is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic).
If an adapter FASTA file is specified in the config file (section 'trimmomatic', param 'adapter_fasta'),
it is used first. Else, 'Adapter1' and 'Adapter2' columns from the readset file are used to create
an adapter FASTA file, given then to Trimmomatic. For PAIRED_END readsets, readset adapters are
reversed-complemented and swapped, to match Trimmomatic Palindrome strategy. For SINGLE_END readsets,
only Adapter1 is used and left unchanged.

This step takes as input files:

1. FASTQ files from the readset file if available
2. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

merge_trimmomatic_stats
-----------------------
The trim statistics per readset are merged at this step.

star
----
The filtered reads are aligned to a reference genome. The alignment is done per readset of sequencing
using the [STAR](https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/) software. It generates a Binary Alignment Map file (.bam).

This step takes as input files:

1. Trimmed FASTQ files if available
2. Else, FASTQ files from the readset file if available
3. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

picard_merge_sam_files
----------------------
BAM readset files are merged into one file per sample. Merge is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

picard_sort_sam
---------------
The alignment file is reordered (QueryName) using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). The QueryName-sorted bam files will be used to determine raw read counts.

picard_mark_duplicates
----------------------
Mark duplicates. Aligned reads per sample are duplicates if they have the same 5' alignment positions
(for both mates in the case of paired-end reads). All but the best pair (based on alignment score)
will be marked as a duplicate in the BAM file. Marking duplicates is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

picard_rna_metrics
------------------
Computes a series of quality control metrics using both CollectRnaSeqMetrics and CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics functions
metrics are collected using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

estimate_ribosomal_rna
----------------------
Use bwa mem to align reads on the rRNA reference fasta and count the number of read mapped
The filtered reads are aligned to a reference fasta file of ribosomal sequence. The alignment is done per sequencing readset.
The alignment software used is [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) with algorithm: bwa mem.
BWA output BAM files are then sorted by coordinate using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

readset Bam files

bam_hard_clip
-------------
Generate a hardclipped version of the bam for the toxedo suite which doesn't support this official sam feature.

rnaseqc
-------
Computes a series of quality control metrics using [RNA-SeQC](https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/rna-seqc).

wiggle
------
Generate wiggle tracks suitable for multiple browsers.

raw_counts
----------
Count reads in features using [htseq-count](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html).

raw_counts_metrics
------------------
Create rawcount matrix, zip the wiggle tracks and create the saturation plots based on standardized read counts.

cufflinks
---------
Compute RNA-Seq data expression using [cufflinks](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cufflinks/).
Warning: It needs to use a hard clipped bam file while Tuxedo tools do not support official soft clip SAM format

cuffmerge
---------
Merge assemblies into a master transcriptome reference using [cuffmerge](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffmerge/).

cuffquant
---------
Compute expression profiles (abundances.cxb) using [cuffquant](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffquant/).
Warning: It needs to use a hard clipped bam file while Tuxedo tools do not support official soft clip SAM format

cuffdiff
--------
[Cuffdiff](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/) is used to calculate differential transcript expression levels and test them for significant differences.

cuffnorm
--------
Global normalization of RNA-Seq expression levels using [Cuffnorm](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffnorm/).

fpkm_correlation_matrix
-----------------------
Compute the pearson corrleation matrix of gene and transcripts FPKM. FPKM data are those estimated by cuffnorm.

gq_seq_utils_exploratory_analysis_rnaseq
----------------------------------------
Exploratory analysis using the gqSeqUtils R package.

differential_expression
-----------------------
Performs differential gene expression analysis using [DESEQ](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html) and [EDGER](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
Merge the results of the analysis in a single csv file.

differential_expression_goseq
-----------------------------
Gene Ontology analysis for RNA-Seq using the Bioconductor's R package [goseq](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goseq.html).
Generates GO annotations for differential gene expression analysis.

ihec_metrics
------------
Generate IHEC's standard metrics.

verify_bam_id
-------------
verifyBamID is a software that verifies whether the reads in particular file match previously known
genotypes for an individual (or group of individuals), and checks whether the reads are contaminated
as a mixture of two samples. verifyBamID can detect sample contamination and swaps when external
genotypes are available. When external genotypes are not available, verifyBamID still robustly
detects sample swaps.
