Tumor Pair Pipeline
=================

The Tumor Pair pipeline inherits the initial bam preparation steps of the DNA-Seq pipeline with the exception of the
indel realignment (IR) step. In the tumor pipeline the IR step utilizes both the normal and tumor bam to further reduce
false positives (FPs) in and around indels. The tumor pipeline deviates from the DNA-seq pipeline at the variant calling step. 
At this point, a paired caller is used to call SNVs and Indels from the pairs given as input. Additional, muliple cancer callers 
are utilized using an ensemble approach and SNVs and Indels seen in at least 2 different callers are retained for further 
investigation.

Example command:
python tumor_pair.py -c a.ini b.base.ini -s x-y,z -r readset.tsv -p pairs.csv

-c ini files: multiple can be specified e.g WGS or exome, or different clusters e.g. base (abacus) or guillimin

-r readset: derived from GQ lims or made yourself. See : https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines#markdown-header-readset-file

-p pairs : format - patient_name,normal_sample_name,tumor_sample_name

picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

skewer_trimming
---------------

bwa_mem_sambamba_sort_sam
-------------------------
The filtered reads are aligned to a reference genome. The alignment is done per sequencing readset.
The alignment software used is [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) with algorithm: bwa mem.
BWA output BAM files are then sorted by coordinate using [Sambamba](http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/index.html)
This step takes as input files:

1. Trimmed FASTQ files if available
2. Else, FASTQ files from the readset file if available
3. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

sambamba_merge_sam_files
------------------------
BAM readset files are merged into one file per sample. Merge is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

1. Aligned and sorted BAM output files from previous bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam step if available
2. Else, BAM files from the readset file

gatk_indel_realigner
--------------------
Insertion and deletion realignment is performed on regions where multiple base mismatches
are preferred over indels by the aligner since it can appear to be less costly by the algorithm.
Such regions will introduce false positive variant calls which may be filtered out by realigning
those regions properly. Realignment is done using [GATK](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/).
The reference genome is divided by a number regions given by the `nb_jobs` parameter.

Note: modified to use both normal and tumor bams to reduce FPs around indels


sambamba_merge_realigned
------------------------
BAM files of regions of realigned reads are merged per sample using
[Sambamba](http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/index.html).

sambamba_mark_duplicates
------------------------
Mark duplicates. Aligned reads per sample are duplicates if they have the same 5' alignment positions
(for both mates in the case of paired-end reads). All but the best pair (based on alignment score)
will be marked as a duplicate in the BAM file. Marking duplicates is done using
[Sambamba](http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/index.html).

recalibration
-------------
Recalibrate base quality scores of sequencing-by-synthesis reads in an aligned BAM file. After recalibration,
the quality scores in the QUAL field in each read in the output BAM are more accurate in that
the reported quality score is closer to its actual probability of mismatching the reference genome.
Moreover, the recalibration tool attempts to correct for variation in quality with machine cycle
and sequence context, and by doing so, provides not only more accurate quality scores but also
more widely dispersed ones.

manta_sv_calls
--------------
Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. It is optimized for
analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs.
Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a
single efficient workflow.
Returns:Manta accepts input read mappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and indel inferences
 in VCF 4.1 format.
