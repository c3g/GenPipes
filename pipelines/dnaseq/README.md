picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

skewer_trimming
---------------

bwa_mem_sambamba_sort_sam
-------------------------
The filtered reads are aligned to a reference genome. The alignment is done per sequencing readset.
The alignment software used is [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) with algorithm: bwa mem.
BWA output BAM files are then sorted by coordinate using [Sambamba](http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/index.html)
This step takes as input files:

1. Trimmed FASTQ files if available
2. Else, FASTQ files from the readset file if available
3. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

sambamba_merge_sam_files
------------------------
BAM readset files are merged into one file per sample. Merge is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

1. Aligned and sorted BAM output files from previous bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam step if available
2. Else, BAM files from the readset file

gatk_indel_realigner
--------------------
Insertion and deletion realignment is performed on regions where multiple base mismatches
are preferred over indels by the aligner since it can appear to be less costly by the algorithm.
Such regions will introduce false positive variant calls which may be filtered out by realigning
those regions properly. Realignment is done using [GATK](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/).
The reference genome is divided by a number regions given by the `nb_jobs` parameter.

sambamba_merge_realigned
------------------------
BAM files of regions of realigned reads are merged per sample using [Sambamba](http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/index.html).

picard_mark_duplicates
----------------------
Mark duplicates. Aligned reads per sample are duplicates if they have the same 5' alignment positions
(for both mates in the case of paired-end reads). All but the best pair (based on alignment score)
will be marked as a duplicate in the BAM file. Marking duplicates is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

recalibration
-------------
Recalibrate base quality scores of sequencing-by-synthesis reads in an aligned BAM file. After recalibration,
the quality scores in the QUAL field in each read in the output BAM are more accurate in that
the reported quality score is closer to its actual probability of mismatching the reference genome.
Moreover, the recalibration tool attempts to correct for variation in quality with machine cycle
and sequence context, and by doing so, provides not only more accurate quality scores but also
more widely dispersed ones.

gatk_haplotype_caller
---------------------
GATK haplotype caller for snps and small indels.

merge_and_call_individual_gvcf
------------------------------
Merges the gvcfs of haplotype caller and also generates a per sample vcf containing genotypes.

combine_gvcf
------------
Combine the per sample gvcfs of haplotype caller into one main file for all sample.

merge_and_call_combined_gvcf
----------------------------
Merges the combined gvcfs and also generates a general vcf containing genotypes.

variant_recalibrator
--------------------
GATK VariantRecalibrator.
The purpose of the variant recalibrator is to assign a well-calibrated probability to each variant call in a call set.
You can then create highly accurate call sets by filtering based on this single estimate for the accuracy of each call.
The approach taken by variant quality score recalibration is to develop a continuous, covarying estimate of the relationship
between SNP call annotations (QD, MQ, HaplotypeScore, and ReadPosRankSum, for example) and the probability that a SNP
is a true genetic variant versus a sequencing or data processing artifact. This model is determined adaptively based
on "true sites" provided as input, typically HapMap 3 sites and those sites found to be polymorphic on the Omni 2.5M SNP
chip array. This adaptive error model can then be applied to both known and novel variation discovered in the call set
of interest to evaluate the probability that each call is real. The score that gets added to the INFO field of each variant
is called the VQSLOD. It is the log odds ratio of being a true variant versus being false under the trained Gaussian mixture model.
Using the tranche file generated by the previous step the ApplyRecalibration walker looks at each variant's VQSLOD value
and decides which tranche it falls in. Variants in tranches that fall below the specified truth sensitivity filter level
have their filter field annotated with its tranche level. This will result in a call set that simultaneously is filtered
to the desired level but also has the information necessary to pull out more variants for a higher sensitivity but a
slightly lower quality level.

haplotype_caller_decompose_and_normalize
----------------------------------------
haplotype_caller_flag_mappability
---------------------------------
Mappability annotation applied to haplotype caller vcf.

Variant effect annotation applied to haplotype caller vcf.
The .vcf files are annotated for variant effects using the SnpEff software.

Provides extra information about SVN by using numerous published databases.
Applicable to human samples. Databases available include Biomart (adds GO annotations based on gene information)
