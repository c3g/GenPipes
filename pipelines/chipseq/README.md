ChIP-Seq Pipeline
=================

ChIP-Seq experiments allows the Isolation and sequencing of genomic DNA bound by a specific transcription factor,
covalently modified histone, or other nuclear protein. The pipeline starts by trimming adaptors and
low quality bases and mapping the reads (single end or paired end ) to a reference genome using bwa.
Reads are filtered by mapping quality and duplicate reads are marked. Then, Homer quality control routines
are used to provide information and feedback about the quality of the experiment. Peak calls is executed by MACS
and annotation and motif discovery for narrow peaks are executed using Homer. Statistics of annotated peaks
are produced for narrow peaks and a standard report is generated.

An example of the ChIP-Seq report for an analysis on public ENCODE data is available for illustration purpose only:
[ChIP-Seq report](http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/tools/chipReport/index.html).

```
picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

trimmomatic
-----------
Raw reads quality trimming and removing of Illumina adapters is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic).
If an adapter FASTA file is specified in the config file (section 'trimmomatic', param 'adapter_fasta'),
it is used first. Else, 'Adapter1' and 'Adapter2' columns from the readset file are used to create
an adapter FASTA file, given then to Trimmomatic. For PAIRED_END readsets, readset adapters are
reversed-complemented and swapped, to match Trimmomatic Palindrome strategy. For SINGLE_END readsets,
only Adapter1 is used and left unchanged.

This step takes as input files:

1. FASTQ files from the readset file if available
2. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

merge_trimmomatic_stats
-----------------------
The trim statistics per readset are merged at this step.

bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam
-----------------------
The filtered reads are aligned to a reference genome. The alignment is done per sequencing readset.
The alignment software used is [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) with algorithm: bwa mem.
BWA output BAM files are then sorted by coordinate using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

1. Trimmed FASTQ files if available
2. Else, FASTQ files from the readset file if available
3. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

samtools_view_filter
--------------------
Filter unique reads by mapping quality using [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/).

picard_merge_sam_files
----------------------
BAM readset files are merged into one file per sample. Merge is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

1. Aligned and sorted BAM output files from previous bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam step if available
2. Else, BAM files from the readset file

picard_mark_duplicates
----------------------
Mark duplicates. Aligned reads per sample are duplicates if they have the same 5' alignment positions
(for both mates in the case of paired-end reads). All but the best pair (based on alignment score)
will be marked as a duplicate in the BAM file. Marking duplicates is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

metrics
-------
The number of raw/filtered and aligned reads per sample are computed at this stage.

homer_make_tag_directory
------------------------
The Homer Tag directories, used to check for quality metrics, are computed at this step. 

qc_metrics
----------
Sequencing quality metrics as tag count, tag autocorrelation, sequence bias and GC bias are generated.

homer_make_ucsc_file
--------------------
Wiggle Track Format files are generated from the aligned reads using Homer.
The resulting files can be loaded in browsers like IGV or UCSC.

macs2_callpeak
--------------
Peaks are called using the MACS2 software. Different calling strategies are used for narrow and broad peaks.
The mfold parameter used in the model building step is estimated from a peak enrichment diagnosis run.
The estimated mfold lower bound is 10 and the estimated upper bound can vary between 15 and 100.
The default mfold parameter of MACS2 is [10,30].

homer_annotate_peaks
--------------------
The peaks called previously are annotated with HOMER using RefSeq annotations for the reference genome.
Gene ontology and genome ontology analysis are also performed at this stage.

homer_find_motifs_genome
------------------------
De novo and known motif analysis per design are performed using HOMER.

annotation_graphs
-----------------
The peak location statistics. The following peak location statistics are generated per design:
proportions of the genomic locations of the peaks. The locations are: Gene (exon or intron),
Proximal ([0;2] kb upstream of a transcription start site), Distal ([2;10] kb upstream
of a transcription start site), 5d ([10;100] kb upstream of a transcription start site),
Gene desert (>= 100 kb upstream or downstream of a transcription start site), Other (anything
not included in the above categories); The distribution of peaks found within exons and introns;
The distribution of peak distance relative to the transcription start sites (TSS);
the Location of peaks per design.

ihec_preprocess_files
---------------------
Generate IHEC's files.


run_spp
-------
runs spp to estimate NSC and RSC ENCODE metrics. For more information: https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools


ihec_metrics
------------
Generate IHEC's standard metrics.


multiqc_report
--------------
A quality control report for all samples is generated.
