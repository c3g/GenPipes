RNA-Seq De Novo Assembly Pipeline
=================================

The standard MUGQIC RNA-Seq De Novo Assembly pipeline uses the [Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/)
software suite to reconstruct transcriptomes from RNA-Seq data without using any reference genome or transcriptome.

First, reads are trimmed with [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic)
and normalized in order to reduce memory requirement and decrease assembly runtime, using the Trinity
normalization utility inspired by the [Diginorm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4802) algorithm.

Then, the transcriptome is assembled on normalized reads using the Trinity assembler. Trinity creates
a Trinity.fasta file with a list of contigs representing the transcriptome isoforms. Those transcripts
are grouped in components mostly representing genes.

Components and transcripts are functionally annotated using the [Trinotate](http://trinotate.sourceforge.net/) suite.

Gene abundance estimation for each sample has been performed using [RSEM](http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/)
(RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization). Differential gene expression analysis is performed using
[DESeq](http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R106) and [edgeR](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/139/) R Bioconductor packages.

The DESeq and edgeR methods model **count data** by a negative binomial distribution. The parameters of
the distribution (mean and dispersion) are estimated from the data, i.e. from the read counts in the input files.
Both methods compute a measure of read abundance, i.e. expression level (called *base mean* or
*mean of normalized counts* in DESeq, and *concentration* in edgeR) for each gene and apply a hypothesis test
to each gene to evaluate differential expression. In particular, both methods determine a p-value and
a log2 fold change (in expression level) for each gene. The Log2 FC of EdgeR is reported in the differential gene
results file, one file per design.

The log2fold change is the logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change condition from condition A to B
(mutation or treatment are the most common conditions). A "fold change" between conditions A and B at a gene
or transcript is normally computed as the ratio at gene or transcript of the base mean of scaled counts
for condition B to the base mean of scaled counts for condition A. Counts are scaled by a size factor in
a step called normalization (if the counts of non-differentially expressed genes in one sample are, on average,
twice as high as in another,  the size factor for the first sample should be twice that of the other sample).
Each column of the count table is then divided by the size factor for this column and the count values
are brought to a common scale, making them comparable. See the [EdgeR vignette](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.12/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeR.pdf) for additional information on normalization approaches used in the pipeline.

The differential gene analysis is followed by a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis.
This analysis use the [goseq approach](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goseq.html).
The goseq is based on the use of non-native GO terms resulting from trinotate annotations (see details in the section 5 of
[the corresponding vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf).

Thus a high quality contigs assembly is created by extracting all transcripts having a functionnal annotation as defined by trinotate,
the Top BLASTX hit and TmHMM annotations are used by default.

Finally, different exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to filtered isoforms expression levels.
Main goals of expression level EDA are the detection of outliers, potential mislabeling,  to explore the homogeneity
of biological replicates and  to appreciate the global effects of the different experimental variables.

An HTML summary report is automatically generated by the pipeline. This report contains description of
the sequencing experiment as well as a detailed presentation of the pipeline steps and results. Various
Quality Control (QC) summary statistics are included in the report and additional QC analysis is accessible
for download directly through the report. The report includes also the main references of the software and
methods used during the analysis, together with the full list of parameters that have been passed
to the pipeline main script.

```
picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

trimmomatic
-----------
Raw reads quality trimming and removing of Illumina adapters is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic).
If an adapter FASTA file is specified in the config file (section 'trimmomatic', param 'adapter_fasta'),
it is used first. Else, 'Adapter1' and 'Adapter2' columns from the readset file are used to create
an adapter FASTA file, given then to Trimmomatic. For PAIRED_END readsets, readset adapters are
reversed-complemented and swapped, to match Trimmomatic Palindrome strategy. For SINGLE_END readsets,
only Adapter1 is used and left unchanged.

This step takes as input files:

1. FASTQ files from the readset file if available
2. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files
