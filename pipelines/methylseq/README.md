Methyl-Seq Pipeline
================

The standard MUGQIC Methyl-Seq pipeline uses Bismark to align reads to the reference genome. Treatment
and filtering of mapped reads approaches as mark duplicate reads, recalibration
and sort are executed using Picard and GATK. Samtools MPILEUP and bcftools are used to produce
the standard SNP and indels variants file (VCF). Additional SVN annotations mostly applicable
to human samples include mappability flags, dbSNP annotation and extra information about SVN
by using published databases.  The SNPeff tool is used to annotate variants using an integrated database
of functional predictions from multiple algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT and MutationTaster, PhyloP and GERP++, etc.)
and to calculate the effects they produce on known genes.

A summary html report is automatically generated by the pipeline. This report contains description
of the sequencing experiment as well as a detailed presentation of the pipeline steps and results.
Various Quality Control (QC) summary statistics are included in the report and additional QC analysis
is accessible for download directly through the report. The report includes also the main references
of the software and methods used during the analysis, together with the full list of parameters
that have been passed to the pipeline main script.

picard_sam_to_fastq
-------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.

trimmomatic
-----------
Raw reads quality trimming and removing of Illumina adapters is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic).
If an adapter FASTA file is specified in the config file (section 'trimmomatic', param 'adapter_fasta'),
it is used first. Else, 'Adapter1' and 'Adapter2' columns from the readset file are used to create
an adapter FASTA file, given then to Trimmomatic. For PAIRED_END readsets, readset adapters are
reversed-complemented and swapped, to match Trimmomatic Palindrome strategy. For SINGLE_END readsets,
only Adapter1 is used and left unchanged.

This step takes as input files:

1. FASTQ files from the readset file if available
2. Else, FASTQ output files from previous picard_sam_to_fastq conversion of BAM files

merge_trimmomatic_stats
-----------------------
The trim statistics per readset are merged at this step.

bismark_align
-------------
Align reads with Bismark

picard_merge_sam_files
----------------------
BAM readset files are merged into one file per sample. Merge is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

This step takes as input files:

1. Aligned and sorted BAM output files from previous bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam step if available
2. Else, BAM files from the readset file

picard_remove_duplicates
------------------------
Remove duplicates. Aligned reads per sample are duplicates if they have the same 5' alignment positions
(for both mates in the case of paired-end reads). All but the best pair (based on alignment score)
will be removed as a duplicate in the BAM file. Removing duplicates is done using [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

metrics
-------
Compute metrics and generate coverage tracks per sample. Multiple metrics are computed at this stage:
Number of raw reads, Number of filtered reads, Number of aligned reads, Number of duplicate reads,
Median, mean and standard deviation of insert sizes of reads after alignment, percentage of bases
covered at X reads (%_bases_above_50 means the % of exons bases which have at least 50 reads)
whole genome or targeted percentage of bases covered at X reads (%_bases_above_50 means the % of exons
bases which have at least 50 reads). A TDF (.tdf) coverage track is also generated at this step
for easy visualization of coverage in the IGV browser.

verify_bam_id
-------------
verifyBamID is a software that verifies whether the reads in particular file match previously known
genotypes for an individual (or group of individuals), and checks whether the reads are contaminated
as a mixture of two samples. verifyBamID can detect sample contamination and swaps when external
genotypes are available. When external genotypes are not available, verifyBamID still robustly
detects sample swaps.

methylation_call
----------------
The script reads in a bisulfite read alignment file produced by the Bismark bisulfite mapper
and extracts the methylation information for individual cytosines.
The methylation extractor outputs result files for cytosines in CpG, CHG and CHH context.
It also outputs bedGraph, a coverage file from positional methylation data and cytosine methylation report

wiggle_tracks
-------------
Generate wiggle tracks suitable for multiple browsers, to show coverage and methylation data.
When using GRCh37 build of Human genome, to be compatible with the UCSC Genome Browser we only keep chromosomes 1-22, X, Y and MT,
and we also rename them by prefixing "chr" to the chromosome anme (e.g. "1" becomes "chr1"), and changing the mitocondrial chromosome from "MT" to "chrM", and keeping the GRCh37 coordinates.

methylation_profile
-------------------
Generation of a CpG methylation profile by combining both forward and reverse strand Cs.
Also generating of all the methylatoin metrics : CpG stats, pUC19 CpG stats, lambda conversion rate, median CpG coverage, GC bias

all_sample_metrics_report
-------------------------
Retrieve all the computed metrics (alignment metrics as well as methylation metrics) to build a tsv report table

ihec_sample_metrics_report
--------------------------
Retrieve the computed metrics which fit the IHEC standards and build a tsv report table for IHEC

bis_snp
-------
SNP calling with BisSNP
